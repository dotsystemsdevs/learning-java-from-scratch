# Learning Java from Scratch

This repository documents my progress in learning Java.

## Module 1: Compilation and Execution
In this module, I learned how a Java program is transformed from source code to a running application.

### Key Concepts
* **Source Code (.java):** The human-readable file where the code is written.
* **Compilation:** The process of translating source code into bytecode using the `javac` command.
* **Bytecode (.class):** The executable file that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs.
* **Execution:** Running the compiled bytecode using the `java` command.

### Essential Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| java -version | Verifies the Java installation. |
| javac FileName.java | Compiles the source file into a .class file. |
| java FileName | Runs the compiled program. |

### Summary
The main takeaway is the distinction between the compiler (javac), which creates the executable file, and the launcher (java), which runs it.
